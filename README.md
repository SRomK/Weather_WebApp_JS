## A functional project of a weather web app to search a city to get to know the actual weather and 5 days forecast


This project was built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for functionalities and an API from OpenWeather to work with external data.

Here I go over each of the steps and technologies I used:


    ######HTML
    Created "index.html" file in project`s root and implemented basic html structure with semantic html tags to reinforce the meaning of the content and to improve SEO 

    ######Images Folder
    Created **img** folder for the favicon icon and inside a separate folder with the weather icons

    ######CSS 
    Created styles folder and inside it I created the specific **style.css** file with a universal selector with pseudo element specifications for the webapp window border-box specs, declared global variables to use within the css file and all the corresponding styles of my project, using type selectors, class selectors and id selectors

    ######Fetching Weather data using OpenWeather APIs 
    First I created the file **api_key.js**, and after creating my account through OpenWeather ([https://openweathermap.org/])

    ######JavaScript 
    I created an **app.js** file and structured it in the following way:
        - At the top of the file you will find all the *global variables* I needed to store the data I required 

## How to run the app:

In order to run the app you will need to have [git] (https://git-scm.com/downloads) previously installed in your system/computer, also run the command ###npm install in your terminal to download required packages, choose a code editor of your choice and follow these steps:

    - Copy URL of the github project: 
    - Open VSCode or editor of your choice, select or create an empty folder to inject the project when cloned 
    - Open Terminal in VSCode
    - Run command ###git clone (repo url)
    - Install Live Server extension in VSCode to compile web app with the web browser of your choice (preferably [Chrome] (https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=es&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop))
